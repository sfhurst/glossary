    This item identifies bridges that do not function adequately due to the horizontal or vertical alignment of the bridge and approach roadway. It is not intended
    that the alignment be compared to current standards, but rather to the existing roadway alignment.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
    The basic criterion is how the alignment of the bridge and approach roadway relates to the general highway alignment for the section of highway the bridge
    carries.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Do not consider speed reductions due to the bridge width or intersecting highways when reporting this item.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The operating speed reduction is in comparison to the posted speed limit for the highway segment:</p>
    <ul class="content-container-paragraphs-ul">
    <li>Use code G when the operating speed is no different at the bridge than the rest of the highway segment that crosses the bridge.</li>
    <li>Use code F when the operating speed is noticeably different at the bridge than the rest of the highway segment that crosses the bridge.</li>
    <li>Use code P when the operating speed is substantially different at the bridge than the rest of the highway segment that crosses the bridge.</li>
