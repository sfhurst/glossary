1. Maybe there needs to be more object combinations like with the modal object being put in the rating form
2. Maybe the form order needs to be assigned somewhere else first and everything gets read from that
3. I don't like how the modal has to assign itself a tab name and then also use that name in its header
4. I would like links and tabs and body elements to be more flexible
5. Maybe the modal needs to have page objects. So a tab = a body somehow.
