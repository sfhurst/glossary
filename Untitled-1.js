    term: "approach roadway alignment",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for horizontal and vertical alignment changes that may influence driver behavior, approach speeds, and sight distance. Poor alignment can increase accident risk, cause uneven loading at the bridge entrance, and contribute to early wear of other components. Watch for sharp curves, sudden elevation changes, and inconsistent cross slopes.",

  },
  {
    term: "approach slabs",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for settlement, cracking, spalling, and differential movement at the joint with the pavement and abutment. Instability can lead to a bump or dip that affects rideability and transfers stress to the bridge components. Look for signs of voids, pumping, and misalignment at the interface points.",
    discipline: "bridge design",
    filter: ["component"],
  },
  {
    term: "bridge joints",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for leakage, tearing, misalignment, and loss of sealant and armor. Proper function is critical for allowing thermal movement and keeping water and debris off substructure and superstructure components. Deteriorated joints can accelerate damage to bearings, beams, and piers.",

    filter: ["component"],
  },
  {
    term: "terminal joints",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for separation, cracking, and misalignment that affects expansion performance and ride quality. These joints manage movement at the interface between approach slabs and pavement on integral and semi-integral structures. Focus on signs of heaving, differential settlement, and asphalt distress.",

  },
  {
    term: "bridge railings",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for impact damage, corrosion, loosened posts, and deformations that could impair the systemâ€™s ability to redirect errant vehicles. Focus on any breaks in continuity, material loss, and structural compromise that could allow penetration or detachment during a collision.",

    filter: ["component"],
  },
  {
    term: "bridge railing transitions",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for structural continuity, damage, and post integrity where a flexible roadside barrier connects to a more rigid bridge system. Deficiencies can compromise the gradual transfer of impact forces, causing vehicles to snag or penetrate at the transition. Look for missing components and excessive deflection.",

  {
    term: "deck",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for cracking, delamination, spalling, scaling, and exposed reinforcement that could affect ride quality, water drainage, and structural performance. Surface defects may signal deeper problems. Underside rust staining, damp areas, efflorescence, or active dripping may indicate water moving through the deck. Check areas near scuppers and joints for concentrated deterioration.",

    filter: ["component"],
  },

  {
    term: "wearing surface",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for cracking, rutting, delamination, potholes, and loss of material. Defects reduce ride quality and allow water intrusion that may deteriorate the underlying deck. Distress patterns can reveal traffic effects and underlying deck issues. Focus on adhesion and thickness uniformity across the surface.",

    filter: ["component"],
  },
  {
    term: "superstructure",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for cracking, corrosion, deformation, section loss, and connection failures. The superstructure transfers loads from the deck to the supports and must maintain alignment and load path integrity. Watch for asymmetry, lateral distortion, and signs of overstress that could signal structural instability.",

    filter: ["component"],
  },
  {
    term: "paint",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for peeling, rust, discoloration, and adhesion loss. As a protective system, paint prevents corrosion on steel components. Coating failure can expose metal to moisture and accelerate section loss. Focus on coverage consistency and failure at connection points and edges.",

  },
  {
    term: "bearings",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for corrosion, displacement, binding, and structural damage. Bearings allow controlled movement and transfer loads to the substructure. Malfunctioning bearings can cause abnormal stress on the structure above. Look for frozen bearings, uplift, and signs of uneven wear.",

  },
  {
    term: "substructure",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for cracking, spalling, erosion, tilting, and settlement. These components support the entire structure and transfer loads to the ground. Deterioration can lead to instability and failure of the bridge system. Check contact points, footing conditions, and signs of undermining and shifting.",

  },
  {
    term: "slopewall",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for cracking, displacement, erosion, and vegetation overgrowth. The slopewall protects the abutment from runoff and prevents underfill loss. Failures can lead to undermining, drainage problems, and structural exposure. Watch for scouring at the toe and separation from adjacent structures.",

  {
    term: "channel",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for alignment shifts, erosion, debris accumulation, and capacity restrictions. Channel health affects flow conditions and bridge stability. Misalignment and obstruction can increase scour and flooding risk. Check for lateral movement, sediment build-up, and changes in flow patterns.",

    filter: ["component"],
  },
  {
    term: "channel protection",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for displacement, deterioration, and voids beneath protective features such as riprap and concrete. These systems safeguard piers and abutments from erosion. Gaps and settling reduce their effectiveness. Focus on continuity, anchoring, and material condition across the protected zone.",

  {
    term: "scour",
    guidance:
      "Should be inspected for exposed footings, voids, undermining, and loss of surrounding material. Scour can critically compromise the foundation. Active signs may include turbulence, sediment shifts, and unusual water patterns. Priority should be placed on known vulnerable locations and post-event inspections.",
    discipline: "bridge design",
    filter: ["component"],
  },
  {
    term: "scour vulnerability",
    guidance:
      "Should be evaluated based on soil type, foundation depth, flow velocity, and hydraulic characteristics. Vulnerability may exist even without visible scour. Consider historical data, design assumptions, and recent flow conditions. Focus on susceptibility indicators and how likely the bridge is to develop scour over time.",

    filter: ["component"],
  },
  {
    term: "overtopping likelihood",
    guidance:
      "Should be evaluated based on channel geometry, bridge elevation, and hydraulic models. A high likelihood may indicate insufficient capacity during floods, leading to roadway submersion. Focus on freeboard, past overtopping events, and changes to watershed and upstream flow control.",
