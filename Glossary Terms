Can I get objects for these items in this format with really detailed definitions that don't restate the term. I want this exact format:
{
term: “”,
definition: “”,
discipline: "bridge design",
page: ["glossary-additional-tab"],
},

I would like my own detailed definition in less than 300 characters for a glossary entry that doesn't restate the term for this item related to bridge inspection or design. It should include the term followed by a colon and then the definition:

iterate

Considerations:
Don't specifically mention bridge design or maintenance.
DO NOT PUT THE TERM IN THE DEFINITION!! !important
Use the most common spelling.
I want them to read like natural glossary entries with sentences that typically start with "A", "AN", or "The"

Can I get an updated definitions for these. I just need the definition.
