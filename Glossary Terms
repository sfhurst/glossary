# Advanced

joint nosing

1. **Provide a clear, robust but concise definition for the term(s):**  
   Ensure the definition explains the term in an accessible and technically accurate way. The definition should be helpful to both bridge engineers and technicians.

2. **Explain what the term is and why it is important:**  
   Don't just define the term—also provide insight into why the term matters and its relevance to bridge inspection, design, and maintenance. This is the part that connects theory to real-world application. Include any practical implications, such as how the term affects daily work or decision-making in the field.

3. **Use straightforward language:**  
   Avoid unnecessary jargon or overly complex terms. Keep the definition as simple and clear as possible, while still maintaining technical accuracy. Aim to explain the term in a way that someone who is encountering it for the first time can understand.

4. **Stick to the most common spelling and phrasing:**  
   If the term is commonly spelled or written in a particular way, use that. Avoid uncommon or excessively technical variations unless necessary for clarity.

5. **Do not start the definition with the term:**  
   Lead with a description or context, then define the term clearly and succinctly.

6. **Avoid dashes:**  
   Keep the definition simple and clean. Use commas or periods instead of dashes for better readability.

7. **Capitalize sentences normally. Use lowercase for the term itself (the glossary entry), unless it's a proper noun:**  
   Keep the terms and definitions in lowercase to maintain consistency with the glossary format. Capitalize only when referring to proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence.

8. **Ensure relevance and practicality:**  
   Keep the definition focused on its real-world applications in bridge design, inspection, and maintenance. Make sure that both engineers and technicians can apply the term in practice.

9. **No filler words or sentences**
   Don't use words like "critical", "essential", or "crucial" to heighten definitions or relationships unnecessarily when a word like "used" can make it simpler and less dramatic. Don't talk about how in engineering it is critical to inspect or assess something.

10. **Return an object in this format:**  
    Use only the filters provided in the list below. You may include more than one if they apply. Do not invent new filters or modify these. Use the most specific and relevant tags from this set:  
    `["acronyms", "bridge", "channel", "components", "compounds", "design", "culvert", "defects", "joints", "materials", "roadway", "NSTM", "org", "wall", "welds"]`  
    Return the object in this exact format, with no quotes around the keys (only around the values):

```javascript
{
term: "intermittent welds",
definition:
"A weld applied in separate, evenly spaced segments along a joint rather than one continuous line. This pattern reduces heat and material use but creates stress points at each segment end. These stress points increase the risk of fatigue cracking. When aligned parallel to the main stress direction, it falls under AASHTO fatigue category E. When placed perpendicular to the stress, it performs better and is classified as category C prime.",
