# Normal

1. Provide a clear, concise but robust definition for pin-and-hanger assembly.
2. Copyright free for publication in my bridge term glossary.
3. Don't start the definition with the term.
4. Explain what it is.
5. Keep the language straightforward and avoid unnecessary jargon or overly technical terms.
6. Use the most common spelling if my term is incorrect.
7. Don't use dashes.
8. Use lowercase unless it is a proper noun.
9. Return a js object in this format that I can paste into my code, note there are no quotes around the keys, only their matched pair is a string:

{
term: "intermittent welds",
definition:
"A weld applied in separate, evenly spaced segments along a joint rather than one continuous line. This pattern reduces heat and material use but creates stress points at each segment end. These stress points increase the risk of fatigue cracking. When aligned parallel to the main stress direction, it falls under AASHTO fatigue category E. When placed perpendicular to the stress, it performs better and is classified as category C prime.",

# Fatigue

1. Provide a clear, concise but robust definition for misdrilled holes. It is a fatigue prone detail.
2. Copyright free for publication in my bridge term glossary.
3. Don't start the definition with the term.
4. Explain what it is.
5. Keep the language straightforward and avoid unnecessary jargon or overly technical terms.
6. Use the most common spelling if my term is incorrect.
7. AASHTO fatigue category B if bolted, D if open, uncategorized if repaired with weld material.
8. Don't use dashes.
