portion of a weld made up of superimposed beads

weld metal - fused filler metal added to the fused structure metal to produce a welded joint or a weld layer

weld penetration - the depth beneath the original surface to which the structure metal has been fused in the
making of a fusion weld; see PENETRATION

weld sequence - the order of succession required for making the welds of a built-up piece or the joints of a
structure, to minimize distortion and residual stresses

weld toe - particularly in a filet weld, the thin end of the taper furthest from the center of the weld cross
section

wheel guard - a raised curb along the outside edge of traffic lanes to safeguard constructions outside the
roadway limit from collision with vehicles

wheel load - the load carried by and transmitted to the supporting structure by one wheel of a traffic vehicle, a
movable bridge, or other motive equipment or device; see AXLE LOAD

weep hole - a hole in a concrete element (abutment backwall or retaining wall) used to drain water from
behind the element; any small hole installed for drainage
